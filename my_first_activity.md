Web Browser: A tool that enables surfing the internet
HTML: A language used to make your own webpages
How does the web work: 
1. user searches for a URL
2. URL is converted into an IP address locally or goes to ISP 
3. If not found on ISP, it goes to DNS
4. ISP then sends TCP link to server with IP
5. Server returns the website data
6. data is rendered on the browser using TCP/IP
